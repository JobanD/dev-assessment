# DEV Assessment

DATABASE IS NOT HOSTED ONLINE
Read below for steps to recreate if needed
This project was created as per the request of a company during the interview process.

## NOTES

Some key things to note:

- The assessment guidelines are in this repo as a pdf file
- I ran this with a local mysql server so if wanting to run program locally you would have to set up your own server and adjust the db connection accordingly in the python files
- Assessment broken down into segments, each part addressed in seperate python files (create, insert, chart, export)
- chart.png can be viewed to see the matplotlib generated by chart.py
- foodcats.csv can be viewed to see the csv file exported by export.py

### To run locally:

- install necessary libraries

```console
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install python-dotenv
```

- Ensure a mysql server is set up and edit the python files as needed to connect to whichever mysql server you want

- Once server is setup run create.py to create database and check if connection has been established
- Once db created and connection is established, run insert.py to create table with data from fastfood.csv
- Next, you can run chart.py to generate a matplotlib generated barchart based on the data from the csv hosted in a mysql db
- Run export.py if you wish to export a csv file categorizing food items into categories and subcategories, an example of this is already in the directory as foodcats.csv
